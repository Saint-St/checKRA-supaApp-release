# KRA PIN Checker: Instant Taxpayer Verification

**Secure KRA PIN Checks with M-Pesa Tokens â€“ **

KRA PIN Checker verifies Kenyan taxpayer PINs instantly using the official KRA API. Designed for businesses, HR, and individuals, it provides accurate taxpayer details (name, type, and status) within seconds. No accounts. No data storage. Every query is processed once and deleted immediately to ensure privacy.

## Key Features

* **Effortless Verification:** Select taxpayer type (Kenyan Resident, Non-Resident, or Company) and enter ID or PIN to get real-time results.
* **Token-Based Access:** All verifications require tokens (no free tier). Buy tokens via M-Pesa as needed.
* **Token Management:** View balance in-app. Each check consumes one token. Tokens are deleted once used up.
* **Simple UI:** Clean Kenyan-themed interface with animations and clear error alerts. Online-only to guarantee up-to-date data.

## How Token Purchases Work

Tokens are required for each verification. Simple, secure, and fast:

1. **Select Tier:** Pick a token package.
2. **Enter Phone:** Input your Safaricom number (e.g., 2547XXXXXXXX).
3. **Initiate Payment:** Tap to send M-Pesa STK prompt and enter your PIN.
4. **Confirm Payment:** Paste the SMS transaction code in the app. Tokens are credited instantly.
5. **Verify:** Use tokens to check PINs. Each use deducts one token until the balance is zero.
